# SageCellFiddle

Here's a demo of one way to turn github gists into live sagecells.

For example, I made a gist at

  https://gist.github.com/kisonecat/cd54d03372dc893632a1aa5360219234

which consists of a couple of examples.

Then

  https://kisonecat.github.io/sagecellfiddle/?cd54d03372dc893632a1aa5360219234

makes it live.

You can do this with any github gist now -- just take the gist id and
stick it at the end of `https://kisonecat.github.io/sagecellfiddle/?`
